# JavaScript Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to null value handling. The `foo` function attempts to add two numbers, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where one or both of the input values are null, leading to unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a correct implementation.
